# Installing from source

These are generic installation instructions. Building from source
requires `cmake` to be installed (<https://cmake.org/>).

## Overview

The simplest way to compile this package is:

1. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type
  `cmake .` to configure the package for your system. This will build
  `madnex` in place.

   However, we strongly recommend building `madnex` out of the source
   tree as follows:
   
   - Create a `build` directory et go in this directory
   - Call `cmake <path_to_madnex_SOURCES>` to configure the directory

   Useful options are listed below.

   Running `cmake` takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
   messages telling which features it is checking for.

2. Type `make` to compile the package.

3. Optionally, type `make check` to run any self-tests that come with
  the package.

4. Type `make install` to install the programs and any data files and
  documentation.

5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
  code directory by typing `make clean`.

## Options

- `enable-website`: generate the TFEL website (enabled by default if
  pandoc is found)
- `enable-portable-build`: do not use processor specific flags.
- `enable-doxygen-doc`: enable the generation of the API documentation
  using with `Doxygen`.

## `cmake` usefull variables

- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`           : two values are supported `Release` and `Debug`
- `CASTEM_INSTALL_PATH`        : specify where the castem has been installed
- `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`       : specify a tool chain file
- `Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS` : select the `python` version to use.
  Note that only the major and minor version of python shall be passed,
  not the revision version or the detection fails.
